2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP PWM_subsystem_inst/PWM_averager_subsystem/sawtooth_scaled_adc_data_reg multiplier stage PWM_subsystem_inst/PWM_averager_subsystem/sawtooth_scaled_adc_data_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP R2R_subsystem_inst/R2R_averager_subsystem/scaled_data_reg multiplier stage R2R_subsystem_inst/R2R_averager_subsystem/scaled_data_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.

DPOP-2#3 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP XADC_subsystem_inst/scaled_adc_data_reg multiplier stage XADC_subsystem_inst/scaled_adc_data_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.

PLIO-3#1 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Partially locked IO Bus is found. Following components of the IO Bus switches_inputs[11:0] are not locked:  switches_inputs[2]
